# AnimalTradingCards
CSS Practice

card.html was created to match the design-prototype.png

The styles.css applies these styles to match the design prototype:
* italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
* bolded labels for the animal's list items
* no dots for the animal's list items
* border around the animal's name, image, and information
* border around the animal's information
* spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
