# AnimalTradingCards
This project was built for the Udacity Introduction to Prorgaming Nanodegree. This project demonstrates an understanding of HTML and CSS. The design prototype below was used to generate HTML and CSS to reproduce the design with an animal of your choice.

![Design Prototype](design-prototype.png)

## Must haves:
The styles.css applies these styles to match the design prototype:
* italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
* bolded labels for the animal's list items
* no dots for the animal's list items
* border around the animal's name, image, and information
* border around the animal's information
* spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
